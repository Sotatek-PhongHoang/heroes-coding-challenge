# The contest

The project is a simple fight simulator between heroes.
In the dashboard screen, I have showed the battle ground and heroes list.
When you click to any hero, he will be added to the battle ground with his avatar and a circle around showing his health and hightlight in the screen. Beside, if you click again to him, he is removed from the battle and inactive in the screen.
The battle starts when minimum two heroes in the battle.
Every second everyone on the battle attach, dealing the damage of the weapon in their hand to all other heroes. the circle around each hero will reduce for total damage taken.
You can change hero's weapon. If hero is on the battle, the damage which this hero deal on the battle is changed.

## Time spent
The project take me about 22 - 24 hours for learning and implemetation

## New feature
For the next plane, I will improve:
- Implement a function which allows user upload him image into profile.
- Improve more animation for smooth battle.
- Add image for weapon and armour, showing it into hero card for user experience
